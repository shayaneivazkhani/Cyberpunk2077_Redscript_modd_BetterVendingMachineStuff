# Cyberpunk2077_Redscript_modd_BetterVendingMachineStuff

This is a mod i made for myself as i run Cyberpunk 2077 from Steam on macOS Tahoe 26 on M1. 
As i could not get CET installed then I started looking for a quick solution for macOS version 
of the game that helped me speed-run the game in 48 hours.

Mod works regardless if you have cyberpunk 2077 or cyberpunk 2077:Phantom Liberty

Only make sure you have correctly installed redscript. I followed the guide from: 
   
   • https://wiki.redmodding.org/cyberpunk-2077-modding/for-mod-users/users-modding-cyberpunk-2077/modding-on-macos

My version is:

﻿   • Redscript ﻿"redscript-v1.0.0-preview.22-macos"
    
   • "input-loader-mac-v1.0"

If you have correctly installed redscript then all you need to do is to place this mod file in

﻿ ﻿  `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Cyberpunk\ 2077/r6/scriptsand`  
     
then launch the app as stated in the guide.
